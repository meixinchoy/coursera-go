Moore's Law suggested that the number of transistors that can be packed into a given
 unit of space will double about every two years. However, there are physical 
 limitations that have prevented Moore’s law from continuing to be true. For 
 instance, the power wall. As the size of the transistors decrease, the density of 
 the transistors increase, which increases the power usage. A high amount of power 
 usage can be hard to achieve especially for laptops that uses batteries. Also, as 
 the power needed increases, the temperature of the chip increases. Eventually, the 
 amount of power needed will be so high that the temperature melts the chip. 
 Although, air cooling is employed to lower the temperature, it cannot lower the 
 temperature completely. According to Dennard scaling, voltage should scale with 
 transistor size, which reduces the dynamic power consumption. It keeps power the 
 consumption and temperature low but it cannot prevent leakage of power. Moreover, 
 the voltage level can’t go lower than the threshold voltage or else noise problem 
 will occur.
